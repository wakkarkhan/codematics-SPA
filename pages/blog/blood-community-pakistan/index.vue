              <p>If we search out for some research reports of Welfare Organizations, Hospitals and Emergency centers
                in Pakistan.
                Their consequences are not much satisfactory as they should be. Especially if we pin point the most
                relevant issue,
                which is less number of <a href="http://cmrevamp.codematics.co/post/blood-donation/">Blood Donors</a>
                in Pakistan as
                compare to its need. There is need of more than 1.6 million blood bags per year in Pakistan. While
                only 10-15%
                general public donates blood voluntarily. These less percentage of figures are alarming concern for
                those victims
                and their families searching for blood during emergency. Because people hesitate from donating blood
                due to lack of
                awareness and benefits of blood donation.</p>
              <h4>Blood Community:</h4>

              <p>Blood Community passionate about expanding its services in other countries of world as well. Because
                there is need
                of more awareness and knowledge among the people towards blood donation and its importance. There is
                very less
                percentage of people who donate blood on regular basis. Saving someoneâ€™s life is most important than
                any other thing

                hesitation.</p>
