              <p>"The Red Liquid circulating in veins structure of human being and other living organisms is called
                <strong><em>Blood</em></strong>". It provides oxygen to heart while removes quantity of waste elements
                in form of
                carbon dioxide. Life-Cycle of living creatures revolve around this whole mechanism. On the other hand
                "When a person
                voluntarily gives blood for transfusion process to other person in need is called <strong><em>Blood
                    Donation</em></strong>". Lab person stores that blood under proper observation for several testing
                procedures to
                make it completely compatible for transfusion. This is basically a social cause without any reward or
                profit in
                return &amp; donor donates blood on his own will. But some organizations and blood-banks compensate
                donors for this
                act of kindness.
              </p>
              <strong>Statistical Measures</strong>
              <p>With every passing minute, thousand of people who suffer from life threatening situation depends on
                blood supply to
                keep their breathes alive. During the emergency situations, there is demand of approximately 1.6
                million blood bags
                in Pakistan annually. Meanwhile more than 5000 children are diagnose with Thalassemia-Major. But the
                dark side of
                these statistics is that there is only 10-20% ratio of donation by general public. Most of the times
                family members
                arrange donations on their own like from relatives and friends. So this analysis is clearly revealing
                the concern of
                how less there is number of people who donates blood on priority basis. There is need of more blood
                supply in
                comparison with its demand scale.</p>
              <strong>Awareness Campaign of Donating</strong>
              <p>For spreading the importance of donating blood, awareness sessions and events should be conducted at
                every platform
                for motivating public towards life savior act. Because there is large number of people who still
                hesitate from
                donating blood due to lack of knowledge and awareness. General Public must be conscious about their
                social and moral
                responsibilities as a human being. Several Non-Governmental-Organizations and Social Institutes are
                working on this
                mission of serving humanity. But they need a proper track and support from government bodies to get a
                gainful
                outcome. It would not be wrong to say that saving one life is saving the whole humanity. </p>
